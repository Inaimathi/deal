# DEAL
##### Lisp-based tabletop game prototyping and playtesting tool 

## Requirements

Deal directly depends on a fuckton of other Lisp libraries, all of which will be installed automatically by [`quicklisp`](http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/) the first time you run it. If you plan on installing Deal manually, the required libraries are

    :alexandria :anaphora :bordeaux-threads :cl-base64 :cl-css :cl-fad :cl-json
    :cl-ppcre :cl-who :deal :flexi-streams :ironclad :optima :parenscript
    :trivial-timeout :usocket

## Installation

**1** Pick a directory, and clone [this project](https://github.com/Inaimathi/deal) with `git clone https://github.com/Inaimathi/deal.git`

**2** Start a lisp in that directory and evaluate `(ql:quickload :deal-ui)`

**3** Evaluate `(deal::start 8080)`

You should now be able to visit `[your-server]:8080/` and play.

## TODO

- Look into iolib/socket as an alternative to the shitty implementation of `read-byte-no-hang`
- Sessions should actually expire at some point
- Add session-expiration hooks
